# AiFilter

AiFilter is a lightweight Chrome extension that automatically appends `-ai` to your Google search queries. The idea? Keep your search results free of AI-generated content. Itâ€™s a simple, toggleable tool that gives you more control over your search experience.

## What It Does

- **Filters Out AI Content:** When enabled, AiFilter adds the `-ai` flag to your query, helping you avoid AI-generated results.
- **Easy Toggle:** A straightforward popup lets you switch the filter on or off anytime.
- **Clean & Customizable:** Styled with a fresh look, different from its RuFilter predecessor.
